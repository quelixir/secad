- Entity status tracking

### 3. Registry Module (`/registry`)
The main business logic module containing:

#### Members (`/registry/members`)
- Member registration and management
- Member types (Individual, Joint, Corporate)
- Contact information and addresses
- Member relationships and associations

#### Securities (`/registry/securities`)
- Security class definition
- Security attributes (voting rights, dividend rights)
- Security symbols and descriptions
- Security status management (active, archived)

#### Transactions (`/registry/transactions`)
- Securities issuance
- Securities transfers between members
- Securities redemptions and cancellations
- Transaction status tracking
- Bulk transaction processing

#### Resolutions (`/registry/resolutions`)
- Corporate resolution management
- Director appointments and removals
- Meeting minutes and decisions
- Resolution status tracking

### 4. Compliance Module (`/lib/compliance`)
- Entity identification validation
- Country-specific compliance rules
- Data validation and formatting
- Regulatory reporting support

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Entities
- **entities**: Main entity records
- **members**: Entity members and stakeholders
- **security_classes**: Security definitions
- **transactions**: Securities transactions
- **resolutions**: Corporate resolutions
- **associates**: Entity associates and contacts

### Key Relationships
- Entities have many Members
- Entities have many Security Classes
- Members have many Transactions
- Security Classes have many Transactions
- Transactions link Members and Security Classes

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Management
- Email-based authentication
- Password reset via email
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based permissions

### Access Control
- Entity-level access control
- User roles (Admin, User, Viewer)
- Permission-based feature access
- Audit trail for sensitive operations

## API Architecture

### REST API Routes
- `/api/entities/*` - Entity management
- `/api/registry/*` - Registry operations
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/associates/*` - Associate management

### tRPC Integration
- Type-safe API calls
- Server-side procedure definitions
- Client-side query/mutation hooks
- Real-time data synchronization
